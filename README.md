GRCF
====
Galaxy Rotation Curve Fit

== Summary
GRCF is an astronomical package for the decomposition of rotation
curves of disc galaxies. GRCF allows to perform the decomposition
of rotation curve on to three galactic components:

- bulge (Sersic model, can be spherical and oblate)
- exponential disc (infinitely thin or with finite thickness)
- halo of the dark matter (isothermal sphere or Navarro-Frenk-White profile). 

There are several fitting techniques:

- brute-force finding of chi-squared minimum
- constant mass-to-light ration hypothesis
- maximal disc hypothesis
- bounded gradient descent algorithm
